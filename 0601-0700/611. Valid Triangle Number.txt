let the range of the numbers be O(U).
1. O(n^2) by double pointers, enumerate one number.
2. we can reduce this problem to the tripartite version of 259. 3Sum Smaller, wlog assume a[i]<=a[j]<=a[k], can form a triangle iff a[i]+a[j]>a[k], i.e. a[i]+a[j]-a[k]>0. use a counting argument. O(n+U log U).

note. this problem is 3sum-hard.
1. If we allow negative edge weights (which doesn't make sense in geometry), we can reduce the tripartite version of 3sum to the tripartite version of this problem.
2. We can reduce 3sum to this problem, by first count the number of solutions once, then add each number by eps and count again. If the count differs then there's a 3sum solution.
